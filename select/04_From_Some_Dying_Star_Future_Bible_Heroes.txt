Your lips are red on red
One kiss and I'd be dead
It's just like Mama said
'Cause you're not human

Your eyes are blue on blue
You're too good to be true
I'd fall in love with you
But you're not human
You're not remotely human

You're from some dying star
I don't know what you are

Your hair is gold on gold
You're seventeen years old
You make my blood run cold
'Cause you're not human
Too beautiful to be human

You're from some dying star
No one knows what you are

Some dying star somewheres
You walked down silver stairs
And somehow magically on into my world

You're from some dying star
I don't know what you are

You're from some dying star
Even you don't know what you are
