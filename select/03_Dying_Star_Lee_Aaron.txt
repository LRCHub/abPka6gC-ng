Vacant words
Fall, like rain
An' softly crash
Down, in vain

Clothes are strewn
We kiss, and lie
The naked truth
Sweet suicide

We fall, like a dyin' star
No angel dust, no divine lust
Could stop it burnin' out
Turn down the lights my love an' fall, like a star

Like nails of fate
Through, a work of art
Darkness creeps
Through this heart

Planted a weed and it grew inta greed
Destroyed an' denied
Nothin' left here to feel nothin' left that is real
Just you, and I

We fall, like a dyin' star
No angel dust, no divine lust
Could stop it burnin' out
Turn down the lights my love an' fall, like a dyin' star

Senses in a crush gotta clear a little dust, an' let it fade away
Bittersweet place it's a bittersweet erase
Slowly wasting away

We fall, like a dyin' star
No angel dust, no divine lust
Could stop it burnin' out
Turn down the lights my love an' fall, like a dyin' star

We fall, like a dyin' star
We fall, like a dyin' star
Fall, like a dyin' star
Fall, like a dyin' star
