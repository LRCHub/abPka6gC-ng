In the back of the bus
I caught you smiling at the rain
Your breath steaming
On the window
You've never looked
So completely sane

Now heaven knows where I am
Heaven knows I did all I can
Heaven knows you'll go far
But heaven knows you're a dying star

In the back of the bus
I caught you smiling at the rain
I turned gliding to the pavement
I've never seen you that way again

Now heaven knows where I am
Heaven knows I did all I can
Heaven knows you'll go far
But heaven knows you're a dying star

I've seen the wave you ride on...
I've seen the wave you ride on...
I've seen the wave you'll die on

Now heaven knows where I am
Heaven knows I did all I can
Heaven knows you'll go far
But heaven knows you're a dying star
