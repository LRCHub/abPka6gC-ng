Desperate again.
Fading away
Like a setting sun
At the end of its days.
These voices of decay
Taking me away.

When you no longer see.
When you no longer feel.

The ride is coming to an end
And you're ready to transcend;
To escape into the distance again.

No more pain.
No more days.

To escape...
To transcend...
This ends here in peace.

As you reflect
On all the things you have left behind,
Making certain peace with your world and walk on.

When you no longer see.
When you no longer feel.
The ride is coming to an end
And you're ready to transcend;
To escape into the distance again.

No more pain.
No more days.

To escape...
To transcend...
This ends here in peace.
