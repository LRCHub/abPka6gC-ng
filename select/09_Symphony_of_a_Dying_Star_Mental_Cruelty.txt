Nature is sleeping, buried under ice
Listen to the winter forest, can't you hear there's no life
Like a symphony, to all those fallen stars
Cheerful the voices, echoes in the past
As I wander the pathway, to the frozen sky
I can't see my footsteps, have I already died
The sun made me blind
Vision starts fooling me I am drifting away
Imprisoned in this endless dismay
Everything that once shined bright
Is covered in the sand of time
No leaves left on the tree of life
No destination will I still arrive
Frostbite burns
I just realized there is no turning back
No feelings, no hope and no fear
My mind is driven to a point of insanity
Everything means nothing in this fog of equilibrium
Take me to the other side
Where cold is warm and all dead alive
I see myself lying on the cold forest floor
Be one with nature and will be no more
Into the night, I fly away
I spread my wings and fade away
My mortal being left behind
As stars align in crimson skies
Everything that once shined bright
Is covered in the sand of time
No leaves left on the tree of life
No destination will I still arrive
Everything that once shined bright
Is covered in the sand of time
No leaves left on the tree of life
Ascend from hell to paradise
